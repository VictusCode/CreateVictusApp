# Contributing

If you're using VictusCode App and would like to help support its development, that would be greatly appreciated!

Several areas that we need a bit of help with at the moment are:

- ⭐ **Star VictusCode App** on GitHub
- 🌐 **Translating**: Help make VictusCode Docs available to non-native English speakers by adding your
  language. See [Translating](#translating) below.
- 📣 **Spread the word** by sharing VictusCode App to help new users discover it
- 🖥️ **Submit a PR** to add a new feature, fix a bug, extend/update the docs or something else

## Translating

1. You can add a translation by copying the English `en` locale
   ([here](https://github.com/VictusCode/CreateVictusApp/tree/master/docs/docs/i18n/en)) directory.
   Rename the directory to the name of your locale, and start translating, after that, you can submit a PR to add your language to the docs.

2. add your language to the `languages` array in the `docusaurus.config.ts` file, `config` > `i18n`.

3. Add your name to the `CONTRIBUTORS` file in the root of ([docs folder](https://github.com/VictusCode/CreateVictusApp/tree/master/docs/CONTRIBUTORS)
